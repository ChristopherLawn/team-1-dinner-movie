# Purpose of Website
The purpose of this website is to simplify date nights and speed up decision-making! Chew View solves a multitude of problems - particularly when you're on the move, stuck on which movie and food pairing to pick, or simpily trying to figure out some options. For example, a user is going on a date night with their partner. The user would turn to Chew View to easily pick a food option and a random movie that they can get excited for. The application facilitates quick API calls which allow the user to: get restaurant selections based on zip code, store the user's previous zip code searches for faster selection, and provide random movie selections or selections based on the user's keyword or title search!
